This is project revolves around cloning the original [**pexels**](https://www.pexels.com/) website.

The project makes use of [**Pixabay API**](https://pixabay.com/api/docs/) for requesting images and details pertaining to the image: the imageURL, user(uploader of image), userImageURL and so much more.

The project features a search bar to enable the user easily search for images
